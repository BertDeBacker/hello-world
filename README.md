# hello-world
First test repository

This file is from now on the most important file in this project.
It will be used for all kind of interaction between team members and their associates.

As from this day forward we will all be unighted and share the same values of courage and self respect.
All other kind of pleasures are prohibited from now and will never take place at the level of master actors and whatever.

I think I have added plenty of the bullshit to this file so that is contains significant changes and make it worthwhile to commit these changes in my first GitHub project that I ever made.

thanks for you attention,

cordialement
